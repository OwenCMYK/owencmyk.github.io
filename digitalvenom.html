		<h3 style="--order: 3">Who am I?</h3>
		<p style="--order: 4">My name is Owen Campbell. Right now I'm a hobbiest video game developer with plenty of personal experience in Python, though I'm open to learning other programming languages. Currently I code solo projects under the username "Owen CMYK", but I look forward to making use of my skills in a professional setting. If you're interested in hiring me for such work, my contacts are at the bottom of the page. If you're not sure, please see the following examples of things I've made during my time working solo.</p>

		<h3 style="--order: 10">What is Radium Blood?</h3>
		<p style="--order: 11">DigitalVENOM: Radium Blood, often just referred to as "Radium Blood" for short, is an arcade style tactical 2D fighting game. It's a sequel to the original DigitalVENOM built from the ground up in a new engine with a custom designed framerate regulation system to make sure the game runs internally at 60 frames per second. The game is written in Python with shaders in GLSL and is not yet available for purchase as development is ongoing. I won't bore you with the technical challenges, but tactical fighting games (usually called "airdashers") are considered to be among the most complicated and difficult games to develop, as such their indie development scene is extremely limited.</p>
